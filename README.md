# ParkingGarage OOP System Design
This is a sample Object Oriented and System Design of a Parking Garage application. It is meant to give an overview of how a parking garage reservation system could
be implemented. A user interface could display a list of available parking spaces, describing where the space is located and what type of car (compact, full, truck, etc.) the space is designed for, and allow a customer to reserve that space.
